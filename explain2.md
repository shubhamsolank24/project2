I have written a recursive function  for this task which takes input of the suffix, path and the list of required files which are found till now. Each time I find a file ending with .c it will be appended to this file.

Run time complexitywill be : O(depth X Avg. number of directory in each level)

Space complexity will be: O(depth)
